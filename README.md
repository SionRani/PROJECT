# 📁 Data Science Projects – Sion Rani Kondepudi

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing practical data science and machine learning projects. This repo includes complete workflows, notebooks, model files, and dashboards built using Python, Excel, and Power BI.

## 📘 Project 1: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

### 🔍 Objective:
Predict the lifetime value (LTV) of e-commerce customers based on behavioral features like session time, app usage, and membership duration.

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization
- Excel for data review

### 📈 Workflow:
- Performed EDA and feature selection
- Built regression model using XGBoost
- Evaluated using MAE and RMSE
- Segmented customers into High, Medium, Low value
- Visualized feature importance

### 📦 Key Files:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Customer_LTV_Prediction.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with model training |
| `ltv_predictions.csv` | Predicted CLV + Segment |
| `final_ltv_predictions.csv` | Full dataset with predicted CLV |
| `xgb_clv_model.pkl` | Trained XGBoost model |
| `Customer Lifetime Value Prediction Model Report.pdf` | 2-page project report |

## 📘 Project 2: HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Prediction

### 🔍 Objective:
Analyze employee data to identify attrition drivers, predict at-risk employees, and offer actionable retention suggestions.

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn, SHAP)
- Power BI for interactive dashboards
- Excel for data preparation

### 📈 Workflow:
- Performed EDA on HR data (departments, salary, promotions)
- Trained classification model (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree)
- Visualized trends using Power BI
- Used SHAP for model explainability
- Drafted HR suggestions for reducing attrition

### 📦 Key Files:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `HR Analytics – Employee Attrition.xlsx` | HR dataset |
| `HR_Attrition_ModelReady.xls` | Cleaned model-ready data |
| `HR DATA ANALYSIS.pbix` | Power BI dashboard file |
| `Attrition_Report.pdf` (to be added) | Prevention suggestions & insights |
